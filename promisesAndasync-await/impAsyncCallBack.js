rej() runs immediately, and marks the Promise as "rejected".

Since no handler was found, an "unhandled rejection" warning is triggered â€”
 but only after the current synchronous code finishes.

// so we will get log for all item
// then after synchronous, asynchronous task will start and will look for its handler, will not found and will throw error

// jab tak question me choice and decision hai tab tak recursion other wise backtracking
// ex for balanced paranthesis we used recursion, isme choice with decision tha ki either we add open or close bracket

//permutation ke question me  jab tak  choice and decision hai tab tak recursion use hota hai mhi to back tracking use hota hai

//agar fixed place bharne hai to ye permutation hai
// balanced paranthesis bhi permutation tha hamare pas 6 place the 6 brackets but kuch condition ke sath bharna tha so we can say it was decision +choise
// agar rahta ke nhi sirf 6 place bhar do kaise bhi order me to backtracking use karte,

//sub set  isame order matter nhi karta ab is same as ba {1,2} is same as {2,1} so order nhi matter karta is type me recursion use hota hai

//imp: in backtracking generally choice is more, some time equal to input size
